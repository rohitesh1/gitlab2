## Issues
Please see the [issues](https://gitlab.com/Commit451/LabCoat/issues) section to report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues.

## Building
You should be able to build the project from Android Studio without any further setup. The app Firebase Fabric for crash reporting, so if you wanted to do a release build, you would need to generate your own Firebase project and place the `google-services.json` file in the `app` directory. Additionally, you would want to make a new keystore, placing the name of the keystore and password in the `app/gradle.properties` file:
```
KEYSTORE_NAME=keystore.jks
KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=keystore_password_here
KEY_PASSWORD=key_password_here
```
To build, run the following:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
or, for release builds:
```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
